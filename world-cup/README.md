# World Cup 2018

Betfair ran a datathon competition for the 2018 world cup.

As part of the content created to support participants, the betfair data-science team produced two model tutorials that would help candidates create their own submissions.
We've created an ELO tutorial as well as a simple machine learning tutorial that you can view here and follow along.
