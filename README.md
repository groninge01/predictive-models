# Predictive Models
This repo includes some of the Data Scientist team's open source predictive models, of which predictions are posted on [The Hub](https://www.betfair.com.au/hub/tools/models/). Models are produced in both R and Python.

## Aim
This repo aims to educate the Betfair community on creating your own end-to-end models to predict sport. It will be extremely informative and descriptive; the goal is for those without much coding experience to be able to read through the process and understand what is being done.

## Tutorials
* Our [Brownlow Medal Predictions Tutorials](https://github.com/betfair-datascientists/predictive-models/tree/master/brownlow) walks you through creating predictions for the Brownlow in in both R and Python.
* In our [EPL Predictions Tutorial](https://github.com/betfair-datascientists/predictive-models/tree/master/epl), we have used publically available data to model odds and create an automated betting strategy.
* Read through our [AFL Predictions Tutorial/Machine Learning Walkthrough](https://github.com/betfair-datascientists/predictive-models/tree/master/afl). This generates weekly predictions for the AFL.
* We have created [FIFA World Cup 2018 Modelling Tutorial](https://github.com/betfair-datascientists/predictive-models/tree/master/world-cup), including a Machine Learning Walkthrough and Elo Model Walkthrough.
